# Team-29

# Spring Boot Backend

# Features

This project is hosting multiple API endpoints that our frontend uses to request and display data.

Such as the Inventory Managment API which notfies our admins about the current stock and if it is low.

Also provides information on where our Useres are creating accounts from based on country location.

# Authentication and Autharization

Our backend uses a JWT token for secure user identification and authentication , they can use this JWT token to log into the website , it is also used
for authorization as it identifies whether the user has ADMIN or USER roles and displays the correct data matching the user roles.

For example only ADMIN role accounts can access the admin dashboard and get inventory management notifications.
