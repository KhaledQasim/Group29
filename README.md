# Team-29

# Spring Boot Backend

# Features

This project is hosting multiple API endpoints that our frontend uses to request and display data.

Such as the Inventory Managment API which notfies our admins about the current stock and if it is low.

Also provides information on where our Useres are creating accounts from based on country location.

# Set-Up

The project is already online 24/7 so all that is needed is to run frontend react app
